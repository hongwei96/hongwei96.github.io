## Description

Vroom Vroom Rider is a two player split screen, 3D racing game. It includes a simple race track with obstacles. Players race against each other as well as 2 AI car. Power-up spawns throughout the race to boost the player or hinder others.

It is made for a school project, under the module Game Development Production. The car assets are not by us. In this project, I'm responsible for the speedometer, mini-map and Simple Car AI.
